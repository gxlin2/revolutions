## inspiration
Relative to the vastnesses of space and the universe, our time here is short and precious but often taken for granted. We wanted to make a product that reminds people of the bigger picture and also to use their time wisely.

## what it does
Revolutions is a goal-setting Chrome extension that helps people track their long-term aspirations.

## how we built it
We used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to code a Chrome extension, and Python to use a GPT API. We collaborated using GitHub and VS Code Live Share.
